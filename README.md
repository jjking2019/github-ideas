## Library for GitHub OSPA Discussion
### Objectives
* Agree to common method for creating OSPA Hands-On Lab documentation using GitHub.
* Begin to develop standard methodology for OSPA teams.
* Determine best mechanism for document creation, edit, and deployment.

### Issues :warning:
* Only selected **OSPA GitHub Admin** individuals will be able to modify Oracle GitHub's Learning-Library/ospa-library repository(Ale, Dan, John, so far...) Having repository "gatekeepers" will avoid conflicts on the production repository.
* OSPA management has decided upon individual folders for different teams/products/labs; to date they are: 
  * analytics
  * appdev 
  * appint 
  * data-mgmt
    * adw 
    * atp 
    * big-data-service
    * db19c
    * exadata-cloud 
    * migration 
  * nosql 
  * oci
  * security
 
* GitHub and Git do not support modification (Cloning, Branching, Merging) of individual files and/or folders; so, 'Clones' and 'Branches' are copies of entire Oracle Learning Library.
* GitHub repositories (repos) have limitations on size of individual files **(100MB)** and total size of repository **(1GB)**.
### Contents
* Contents stored on GitHub will be:
  * .md (Markdown) files - These are the main files containing labs instructions
  * .html (HTML5) files - [Optional] If developers want to wrap the content and make it available on a static web site
  * misc. SMALL lab files [Optional]
  * larger files will be **LINKED-to** not included in-line [Optional]
* Developers will create and modify content then pass it to "Admins" to update in staging learning-library and ultimately production learning-library.
* Content should be simple and limited to only what is needed to complete the lab; this might include text, partial screenshot pictures, and other things that help the learner complete the demo. 
<br/>-- THIS IS NOT A MARKETING TOOL NOR A PRESENTATION AND "NORMAL" LP FORMATTING MAY NOT APPLY
<br/>---- No need for "section header" and "title" images; keep images small and to the point if used at all
<br/>---- These are lab guides; keep it simple and easy; link to complex explanations, videos, etc...

* Developers will be responsible for CE and QA of their own material; peer review will be essential
* Documents will be stored in appropriate folders in learning-library/ospa-library
  * Developers might create entirely new documents
  * Developers might modify existing documents
* We have added a 'common-content' folder (managed by the Admins) containing assets to be used when creating HTML files to provide a common 'wrapper'
* We have added a 'common/images' folder where developers may add images to be shared cross-team
* We have added a Slack channel 'go-ospa-github' for all to share; Developers and Admins will use it to communicate back-and-forth
* Once our process is finalized we will need a webcast recording to show developers the process and tools required to build content 
### Tooling
* We suggest a simple editor for Markdown like the Microsoft Visual Studio Code tool available on [MyDesktop](http://mydesktop.oraclecorp.com/myd/myd_software_licenses.show_complete_list) though any text editor will do

### Mechanism
* Three-level OSPA repository (repo) scheme
   1. Oracle Learning-Library (production)
   1. OSPA Learning-Library (staging, one of Ale's, Dan's, or John's - tbd)
   1. One 'Developer Repo' for each folder identified earlier
      1. Developers will have full authority to Developer Repos - **Note: Developers Github Access is required**
      1. Developers will create, modify, and review documents in Developer Repos
      
   [Rationale behind three-level repository](threelevel.md)

### Alternative Mechanism (not our favorite)
* Two-level OSPA repository (repo) scheme
   1. Oracle Learning-Library (production)
   1. OSPA Learning-Library (staging, one of Ale's, Dan's, or John's - tbd)
* Developers create .zip file for desired folder and make it available to "Admins" for unzip and load. Zip file will be shared using email, LCMS, or Slack (go-ospa-github). - WCGW? :pray:
* Developer Github access is not required

### Suggested Workflow(s)
   1. (If new) Developer checks to see if appropriate folder already in repository; if not, request from "Admins"
   1. Developer creates (or gets from somewhere) desired content, makes sure it is in proper form (.md, .html), and that all large files are linked-to rather than part of document (we need to decide if links will be to Confluence, OraDocs, LCMS, etc...)</br>
   __NOTE:__ We can supply a command to copy a relevant folder to a developer's machine
   1. Developer will push to appropriate "Developer Repo" (e.g. ospa-lib-appdev)
   1. Developer (peers, maybe manager, maybe testers...) review content in GitHub; repeat 2-3-4 cycle until happy
   1. Developer notifies "admin" that "Developer Repo" is ready to go
   1. Admin synchronize from "Developer Repo" into "Staging Repo" through script or command line; performs cursory check of file sizes and formatting
      1. Admin runs script (in-house script, see menu below)
      1. Admin selects developer repository to update
      1. Changes are automatically committed to Staging repository
      
      ![](./images/script.png)
      
      
   1. Developer (and team) review document in "Staging Repo" and let Admin know when ok
   1. Admin __MERGEs__ from "Staging Repo" to "Production Repo" - lets Developer know of success/failure
   1. Developer performs final check of "Production Repo"

### Demo
We were asked to create a "live demo" of how this will work; here are the steps we will follow:

1. John will demo [oracle/learning-library/ospa-library](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library) ("Production Repo"); [jjking2019/learning-library/ospa-library](https://github.com/jjking2019/learning-library) ("Staging Repo"), and the "Developer Repos"
1. Ale will create new document for security folder and post to ospa-security "Dev Repo"
1. Ale (and peers/manager) will review content
1. Ale will let John know (email or slack) that changes are ready to go
1. John will push content to "Staging Repo"
1. Ale (and peers/manager) will review on "Staging Repo"
1. Ale will let John know changes ok
1. John will merge changes to "Production Repo"
1. Ale will double-check on "Production Repo"
